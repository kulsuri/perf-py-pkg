## How to report a bug or request a feature

Report bugs or request features using the ready-made templates on the [Issue Tracker].

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.9+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run python
>>> import perf_py_pkg as ppp
```

[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

[pytest]: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/

## How to submit changes

### Step 1 - Check issue tracker

Ensure that the issue you are working on is not already open by searching the [issue tracker].

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything. This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach. Please create an issue if one does not already exist, ensuring that you follow the issue template.

### Step 2 - Create a branch

Create a new branch from main for your changes. Please ensure that your branch adheres to the naming convention `category/issue-reference/description`

**Category**

Pick one of the following categories for your branch:

- `feature` - for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
- `bugfix` - for fixing a bug
- `hotfix` - for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
- `test` - for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket

**Reference**

After the category, there should be a "/" followed by the reference of the issue/ticket you are working on. If there's no reference, just addÂ no-ref.

**Description**

After the reference, there should be another "`/`" followed by a description which sums up the purpose of this specific branch. This description should be short and "kebab-cased".

By default, you can use the title of the issue/ticket you are working on. Just replace any special character by "`-`".

**Examples**

```bash
git branch feature/issue-42/create-new-button-component
git branch bugfix/issue-342/button-overlap-form-on-mobile
git branch hotfix/no-ref/registration-form-not-working
git branch test/no-ref/refactor-components-with-atomic-design
```

### Step 3 - Commit changes

Commit your changes to the branch you created in the previous step.

A commit message should start with a category of change. You can pretty much use the following 4 categories for everything:Â feat,Â fix,Â refactor, andÂ chore.
Please ensure that your commit message adheres to the following format:
| Category | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| feat | Adding a new feature |
| fix | Fixing a bug |
| refactor | Changing code for performance or readability |
| chore | For everything else (documentation, formatting, tests, cleaning code, etc.) |

> Feel free to use emojis to make your commit messages more expressive. The VSCode extension [Gitmoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seatonjiang.gitmoji-vscode) is a great tool for this.

**Examples**

```bash
ðŸŽ‰ feat: py package scaffolding
chore: update documentation readme
feat: add new button component
fix: fix division by zero error
refactor: refactor method to improve performance
```

### Step 4 - Open pull request

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly. Documentation is built and deployed automatically via GitHub actions.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```
